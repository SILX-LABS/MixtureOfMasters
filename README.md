‚ö†Ô∏è Early Experimental Work  
This research is part of the Quasar project ‚Äî our ongoing search for better architectures for language modeling.  
It has not been tested on large-scale clusters or production workloads.  
These are early-stage experiments intended to explore new frontiers in sparse expert architectures.

## Overview

Mixture of Masters (MoM) is a sparse expert architecture that rethinks how expert specialization and routing are implemented.  
Unlike traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models that rely on discrete routing decisions, MoM introduces **continuous Master activation** through **shared flow context** and **adaptive routing**.  

This approach eliminates routing instability, improves specialization consistency, and achieves strong training stability, while preserving the computational benefits of sparse expert systems.  
MoM is built on top of Flow Attention, leveraging its linear-time bidirectional information flow as a foundation for efficient expert collaboration.

## Architecture

MoM replaces the traditional top-k routing used in MoE with a shared flow context mechanism.  
Instead of selecting a subset of experts, all Masters are always active and contribute adaptively to the final output.  
Each Master specializes in a different processing role (e.g., syntax, semantics, reasoning, memory), and their contributions are dynamically weighted through token temperature gating and adaptive gating.

Key architectural components include:

- **Shared Flow Context** ‚Äî a global information stream that all Masters read and write to.  
- **Token Temperature Gating** ‚Äî intelligent routing based on token complexity, enabling efficient specialization.  
- **Adaptive Master Gating** ‚Äî continuous weighting of Masters rather than discrete selection.  
- **Master Specialization** ‚Äî distinct processing functions for different types of information.  
- **Stable Training Dynamics** ‚Äî consistent gradient flow without expert collapse.

This results in an architecture that maintains linear scaling efficiency while enabling fine-grained specialization and collaboration between expert modules.
